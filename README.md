THIS ASSIGNMENT IS FOR THE SUBMITION FOR THE INTERVIEW ROUND OF ARYA.ASSIGNMENT
THE PROBLEM STATEMENT WAS OF UNSUPERVISED DATA AND HAVE TO CLASSIFY THE TEST DATA

SO FIRST I EDA THE DATASET WITH HAVING NO CONCRETE FEATURES  I PERFORMED NORMAL BAR GRAPH
PLOTTING AND LABEL CATEGORIES.

NOW THE FIRST TASK IS TO DIVIDE THE DATATSET INTO THE 4:1 WHICH MEANS 80% TRAIN 20% TEST.

AFTER TRAIN TEST SPLIT FIRST STEP WAS TO FIND THE HIGH CORRELATING FEATURES AND REMOVE THOSE 
FEATURE WHICH HAVE MORE THAN 0.5 VALUE IN POSTIVE AND NEGATIVE ALSO.

AFTER REMOVING THOSE FEATURES NEXT STEP IS TO APPLY PREPROCESSING LIKE STANDARDIZATION 
FOR THAT WE USED STANDARD SCALER.

THEN WE USED RANDOMFORREST CLASSIFIER

AFTER THAT TRAINING IT WITH TRAIN DATA WE PREDICT IT WITH THE TEST DATA AND COME UP WITH
THE FOLLOWING REPORT
